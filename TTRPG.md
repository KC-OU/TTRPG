## What are Tabletop Role-Playing Games?
Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) are immersive storytelling experiences where players collaboratively create and explore fictional worlds through imagination, dice rolls, and character interactions. Unlike video games, TTRPGs rely on verbal communication, creative problem-solving, and shared narrative building, providing a unique form of interactive storytelling.

## Core Mechanics
In a typical TTRPG, participants assume the roles of characters within a predetermined setting. One player, known as the Game Master (GM) or Dungeon Master (DM), acts as a storyteller and referee, describing the world, controlling non-player characters, and establishing challenges. Other players create individual characters, making decisions, rolling dice to determine outcomes, and progressing through the narrative.

## Key Components
1. Rulebook: Provides game mechanics, character creation guidelines, and world-building frameworks
2. Character Sheets: Detailed records of character attributes, skills, and progression
3. Dice: Typically polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) used to resolve actions and determine success
4. Imagination: The most crucial element, enabling players to collaboratively create rich, dynamic stories
