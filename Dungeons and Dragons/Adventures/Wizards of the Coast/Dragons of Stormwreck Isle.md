## Introduction 

Thunder rolls across dark waters as lightning illuminates the jagged rocks that have claimed countless ships along the treacherous coastline of Stormwreck Isle. This remote island, perpetually shrouded in storm clouds, holds secrets as ancient as dragonkind itself. Here, where the tempest meets the sea, three mighty dragons wage an endless war for supremacy, their conflict reshaping the very landscape with each passing season.

In the mountain peaks that pierce the storm clouds dwells Frostwind, an ancient white dragon whose icy breath freezes the rain into deadly hailstorms. The western cliffs belong to Tempest, a bronze dragon who commands the lightning and uses the constant storms to guard her clutch of eggs. Deep within the island's dormant volcano, Emberclaw the red dragon plots and schemes, viewing both the isle and its surrounding waters as his rightful domain.

Caught between these titanic powers are the island's other inhabitants: a hardy settlement of shipwrecked survivors who've built a life in the protected harbor of Haven's Rest, tribes of kobolds who shift their allegiances between the dragons as survival demands, and ancient ruins that hint at a civilization that learned too late the price of drawing dragons' ire.

For adventurers brave or foolish enough to venture here, Stormwreck Isle offers both peril and promise. The dragons' hoards contain treasures beyond imagination, and the ruins hold artifacts of tremendous power. Yet few who seek such prizes survive to claim them, for the dragons guard their territories jealously, and the storms themselves seem to conspire against intruders.

The isle itself is a character in this tale, its terrain as treacherous as it is diverse. Frozen peaks give way to subtropical valleys where steam rises from hot springs, while the coastline ranges from sheer cliffs to volcanic black sand beaches. The constant storms have carved vast cave networks throughout the island, providing sanctuary for those who know where to lookâ€”and deadly traps for those who don't.

Every seven years, when the moons align and the storms reach their peak, the dragons engage in a spectacular aerial battle known as the Tempest Dance. The outcome of this contest determines control over the island's most coveted territories until the next alignment. It is during these times that opportunistic adventurers often attempt to explore the temporarily abandoned dragon lairs, though such endeavors rarely end well for the intruders.

Welcome to Stormwreck Isle, where dragon fire meets lightning's fury, and every survival is a victory against nature itself. Will you brave the storms to uncover its secrets, or become another tale whispered by the survivors in Haven's Rest?
