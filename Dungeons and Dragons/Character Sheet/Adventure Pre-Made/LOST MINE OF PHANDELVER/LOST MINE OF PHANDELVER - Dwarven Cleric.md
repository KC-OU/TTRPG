# Backstory and information

Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries. Since then, you have devoted yourself to your deity.

_**Personal Goal: Teach the Redbrands a Lesson.**_ You’ve heard that Daran Edermath in the town of Phandalin is looking for people of courage and principle to teach some bullies a lesson. These thugs, the Redbrands, have been throwing their weight around in Phandalin, much as your compatriots did in Neverwinter. Putting a stop to their villainy is a worthy goal.

_**Alignment: Neutral Good.**_ Your conscience, not law and authority, will guide you to do the right thing. Power is meant to be used for the benefit of all, not to oppress the weak.

# Traits

**Spellcasting Ability**. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells. 
- The saving throw DC to resist a spell you cast is 13. 
- Your attack bonus when you make an attack with a spell is +5. See the rulebook for rules on casting your spells. 

**Disciple of Life**. Your healing spells are particularly effective. 
- Whenever you restore hit points to a creature with a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. 

**Darkvision**. You see in dim light within a 60-foot radius of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Dwarven Resilience**. You have advantage on saving throws against **poison**, and you have resistance against poison damage. 

**Dwarven Toughness**. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level (included). 

**Mercenary Sergeant.** You were a minor officer among the Mintarn mercenaries, a position that still gets you some perks. Even though you’re not on active duty, Mintarn soldiers recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can requisition simple equipment and horses for temporary use. You can also gain access to Mintarn mercenary encampments and fortresses.

I have three cousins—Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro Rockseeker—who are my friends and cherished clan members.
